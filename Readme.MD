### Premise for OVERGROWTH
The world has been taken over by plants after massive droughts sought to destroy humanity. A group of scientists came together to combat mass extinction, they looked into prehistorical plants that thrived in harsh conditions. By splicing dna of modern plants and various strains of randomly collected DNA it began as a success. Untill the moment where contaminents were found in the dna and the plants morphed into something more ominous.
